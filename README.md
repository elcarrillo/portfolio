<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

Building your own personal website from this project can take as little as 30 minutes. Follow the setup instructions below. Please feel free to reach out by filing an [issue](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb/portfolio/issues) or emailing for help configuring your project.

## Prerequisites

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your PC. You should also own a GitHub account.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
    ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
    ``` 

2. Edit the configuration files:
    - Update the `config/config.js` file to customize profile, projects, research, and updates.
    - Replace `profile.png` in `config/profile.png` with your image. 
    > **Note**: Rename your image file as `profile.png`.

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
      npm install
      npm run build
    ```

## Testing

1. To test on your local server:
    ```sh
      npm run dev
    ```

2. Open the browser to http://localhost:3000/

## Deployment

If it works locally, you can deploy your project to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages provides two types of free domains, `<username>.github.io` and `<username>.github.io/<repository>`. Choose the one that suits your needs.

### Deploy to `<your-username>.github.io/portfolio`

Simply commit and push your changes to GitHub. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#overview) will handle the deployment. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio`.

## **How to Remove Advanced Features**

### 1. Google Analytics
- Locate the `Measurement ID` (e.g., `G-LJYYDQTM1K`) in the `_app.js` file or configuration.
- Remove or comment out the Google Analytics tracking script.

### 2. Sitemap.xml
- Delete the `sitemap.xml` file from the project directory if it‚Äôs not required.
- Optionally, remove any references to the sitemap in the `robots.txt` file (if applicable).

### 3. Google Search Console Verification
- Since the verification meta tag is included in the `_app.js` file:
  1. Open the `_app.js` file in the `pages/` directory.
  2. Locate the meta tag:
     ```jsx
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
     ```
  3. Remove the meta tag or replace `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` with your own Google Search Console verification code.
  4. If you no longer need custom meta tags, reset `_app.js` to its default structure:
     ```javascript
     import '../styles/custom.global.scss'

     function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
       return <Component {...pageProps} />
     }

     export default MyApp
     ```
- Save the file and redeploy your project.
